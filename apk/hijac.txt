adb shell ------ then


settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services com.baronkiko.launcherhijack/com.baronkiko.launcherhijack.AccServ

settings put secure accessibility_enabled 1

settings put secure accessibility_enabled 0
settings delete secure enabled_accessibility_services 



New hack:

Edit: before doing this first uninstall LauncherHijack if you have it still installed.

First install the cloned LauncherHijack.apk

Then install the app-debug.apk
(don't pay attention to its UI if it shows, it's just a template, the important part is that when it opens it configures the accessibility variables as needed)

Then grant it the required permission by running:

adb shell pm grant com.example.settest.settingstest android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS

Then open the application (SettingsTest), after you do that, LauncherHijack should open automatically.
(if it doesn't and it still complains when you open it then something did not work as intended)

After you're done you can uninstall SettingsTest.

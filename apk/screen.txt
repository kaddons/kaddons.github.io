This guide is very easy to follow, but the most difficult part is determining the Package Name and the Service Name for the screensaver you want to use, which you will need to do to follow the guide. The package name can be determined by following this guide, but the service name is a bit more difficult. If you have an Android phone or tablet, the easiest way to determine the Daydream service name of the screensaver you want to use on your Fire TV is to install the screensaver on your phone/tablet, connect via ADB, and run the shell command:
adb shell settings get secure screensaver_components

This will output:
[PACKAGE_NAME]/[SERVICE_NAME]

If you don’t have an Android phone or tablet, you can use the aapt utility from the Android SDK to view all services of an APK file by running the command:
aapt dump xmltree [PATH-TO-APK] AndroidManifest.xml
aapt dump xmltree [PATH-TO-APK] AndroidManifest.xml > [PATH-TO-TXT]AndroidManifest.txt

android.permission.BIND_DREAM_SERVICE

The services of the APK will be listed under the E: service sections, next to the labels A: android:name. If there are multiple services, you’ll have to try each one to determine which is the Daydream service.
Guide

    Sideload the screensaver APK onto your Fire TV or Fire TV Stick. The one used in this guide is Aerial Dream, which can be downloaded here.
    Connect to your device via ADB.
    Enter ADB shell by running the command: adb shell
    Set the new screensaver by running the command:
    settings put secure screensaver_components [PACKAGE_NAME]/[SERVICE_NAME]

    Be sure to replace [PACKAGE_NAME]/[SERVICE_NAME] with the correct names from the APK you’re using. See the section above for determining these names. For example, the command for the Aerial Dream screensaver is:
    settings put secure screensaver_components com.codingbuffalo.aerialdream/com.codingbuffalo.aerialdream.AerialDream
    (OPTIONAL) Verify that the screensaver was set by running the command:
    settings get secure screensaver_components

    You should see the package name and service name, that you just entered in the previous step, printed out.
    That’s it. Your new screensaver is set. If you’d like to change your screensaver timer settings, see this guide and this guide.
